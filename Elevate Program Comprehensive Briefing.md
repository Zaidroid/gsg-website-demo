## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the [[Gaza Sky Geeks]] (GSG) [[Elevate Program]], a flagship initiative by [[Mercy Corps]] designed to empower Palestinian tech and digital service companies. The program aims to foster sustainable growth by enhancing talent pipelines, expanding market access, and amplifying digital presence, enabling companies to scale locally, regionally, and globally.

The [[Elevate 2.0/elevate 2.0]] cohort for 2025 underwent a rigorous, multi-stage selection process, beginning with 94 applications from the West Bank and Gaza. Through two systematic filtration stages based on eligibility and a weighted scoring system, the pool was narrowed to 50 shortlisted companies. Following in-depth interviews with 48 of these firms, an evaluation committee allocated specific interventions based on demonstrated needs. Ultimately, 33 companies were selected to receive support across three core pillars: **[[Capacity Building]]** (Train-to-Hire, Upskilling), **[[Marketing & Branding]]** (Agency support, Marketing Resource stipends), and **[[Market Access]]** ([[C-Suite]] Coaching, [[Legal Support]], [[Conference Participation]]). An additional 15 companies were placed on a waiting list, pending further funding.

A key strategic initiative is the revival of the "[[Job Hunters]]" program under the new name [[ElevateBridge]], which pairs experienced Upwork freelancers with Palestinian agencies to secure international contracts. GSG is actively negotiating with the [[Upwork]] Foundation to secure promo codes valued at approximately $200 per month per agency to cover platform costs. Initial offers from Upwork were limited to non-profits, but GSG has advocated for the inclusion of for-profit Palestinian companies, arguing for their dual business and social impact within the local tech ecosystem.

The operational context is significantly shaped by the ongoing crisis, which has severely impacted Gaza-based companies and freelancers. Many have lost offices, equipment, and team members, with some relocating operations to Egypt or Oman to maintain business continuity. A survey of Gaza-based mentors and freelancers highlights critical needs, including reliable internet, new hardware, job opportunities, and psychological support, underscoring their resilience as many continue to work amidst profound challenges.

## 1. The Elevate Program: Mission and Interventions

The Elevate Program, a Gaza Sky Geeks and Mercy Corps initiative, is a business growth program designed to help Palestinian tech and digital service companies overcome political and economic obstacles.

## 2. Elevate 2.0 (2025 Cohort) Selection Process

The selection process for the 2025 cohort was a comprehensive, multi-phased evaluation designed to identify companies with the highest potential for growth and impact.

### 2.1 Application and Initial Screening

- **Application Period:** GSG announced the application via social media and email from February 13 to March 11, 2025.
- **Initial Applications:** A total of 94 applications were received from 86 unique companies across the West Bank (WB) and Gaza.
- **First Filtration (March 23-26, 2025):** The 94 applications were screened against basic eligibility criteria. 75 companies passed, while 19 were disqualified.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Disqualification Reason|Number of Companies|
|Incomplete Application|6|
|Duplicate Application|7|
|Not Registered in Palestine|1|
|Not Operating (0 active clients)|2|
|Ineligible Sector|1|
|**Total Disqualified**|**19**|

### 2.2 Second Filtration and Shortlisting

- **Scoring Criteria:**
    - **Company Type (40%):** Service-based companies received the highest score (5), followed by product-based (3) and non-technical (1).
    - **Company Size (40%):** Assessed based on year of establishment, number of employees, 2024 clients, and 2024 annual revenues.
    - **Gender Equity (20%):** Companies with over 50% female team members received the highest score (5).
- **Diversity and Fairness Ranking:** To ensure representation, companies were ranked by size score (Rank A, B, C) with adjusted passing thresholds.
    - **Rank A (Size score ≥ 4) & Rank B (Size score ≥ 2 and < 4):** Required a final score of ≥ 70% to pass.
    - **Rank C (Size score < 2):** Required a final score of ≥ 60% to pass.
- **Outcome:** 50 companies were shortlisted for the interview phase. Notably, Asal Company was excluded despite a high score due to challenges in a previous cohort, including delayed responses and eventual withdrawal.

### 2.3 Assessment Interviews and Intervention Scoring

- **Interviews (April 23 - May 8, 2025):** The Elevate team conducted onsite and online meetings with 48 of the 50 shortlisted companies to validate their needs.
    - Appia Tech did not respond to the meeting invite.
    - Future Information System - FIS canceled and rescheduled multiple times.
- **Meeting Breakdown:** 26 online meetings with WB companies, 10 onsite visits in Ramallah, 3 meetings rescheduled to online, and 9 online meetings with Gazan companies.
- **Intervention Scoring Matrix:** Following the interviews, a committee of four members voted on seven potential intervention components for each of the 48 companies. A component was approved if it received at least 3 out of 4 votes.

## 4. Partnership with Upwork Foundation

GSG has a long-standing partnership with the Upwork Foundation, dating back to a team visit to Gaza in 2018. To further support Palestinian tech agencies, GSG is seeking to restart its "Job Hunters" initiative.

### 4.1 "Job Hunters" Initiative

- **Concept:** Experienced and successful Upwork freelancers ("Job Hunters") are hired and assigned to Palestinian tech service agencies. Their sole role is to win projects on Upwork for the agency.
- **History:** A similar initiative ran successfully in 2021 and 2022 for 6 agencies, enabling them to win numerous small and medium-sized projects.
- **Current Goal:** To restart the program, which was paused in October 2023, and seek support from the Upwork Foundation.

### 4.2 The Request and Negotiation

GSG estimates that each agency needs approximately $200 per month to be competitive on Upwork. The request to Upwork Foundation is for promo codes to cover these costs for 12-24 months.

- **Cost Breakdown per Agency per Month:**
    - **Agency Plus Membership:** $19.99
    - **Connects (880–1,320):** 132–198
    - **Total Estimated Cost:** **152–****218**

Hawwa Muhammad from Upwork initially offered support for non-profit organizations. Alan El-Kadhi and Mohammed Zourob of GSG countered by arguing for the inclusion of for-profit Palestinian companies, emphasizing their unique dual social and business roles in a constrained economy.

"In the Palestinian context, the traditional lines between non-profit and for-profit entities are blurred. Companies here operate with a dual-purpose mission: to achieve profitability while also serving a critical social role." - Mohammed Zourob

This advocacy led to a scheduled meeting with Upwork leadership on September 11, 2025. Upwork also agreed to increase its support for individual freelancers from 50 to 100 promo codes for the "GSG Freelance Club 100."

## 5. Implementation and Partner Engagements

### 5.1 Marketing Agency Engagement: DigiFy

GSG contracted the marketing agency **DigiFy** to provide support for nine selected tech companies.

- **Goal:** Boost the companies' digital presence to compete internationally.
- **Timeline:** The project kicked off on August 21, 2025, with a final report due November 30, 2025.
- **Scope & Deliverables:** The engagement includes needs assessments, developing marketing and brand strategies, content creation (2 videos and 20 designs per company), social media management, SEO optimization, and 20 hours of coaching per company.
- **Communication:** Official communication is conducted via email, supplemented by WhatsApp groups for quick updates. Special considerations, such as potential internet delays, are being made for companies in Gaza.

### 5.2 Participant Agreements and Compliance

Participating companies, such as Edubook and Yummy, signed a **Marketing and Branding Support Agreement** with Mercy Corps. These agreements, financed by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, outline mutual responsibilities.

- **GSG-MC Responsibilities:** Hire and cover the costs of a marketing agency, monitor activities, and provide necessary linkages.
- **Recipient Responsibilities:** Collaborate closely with the agency, designate a point of contact, participate in surveys, and report any challenges.
- **Code of Conduct:** All partners must adhere to the **Mercy Corps Partner Code of Conduct**, which sets strict standards against abuse, exploitation, harassment, and corruption. It requires partners to uphold humanitarian values, respect local laws, and report any breaches through the Mercy Corps Integrity Hotline.

## 6. Contextual Challenges: The Gaza Crisis

The operating environment, particularly for entities in Gaza, is profoundly impacted by the ongoing crisis.

### 6.1 Impact on Companies

Several companies in the Elevate cohort have faced severe disruptions:

- **AccessLine:** Staffing dropped from 35 employees to 9, with the remaining team distributed across Gaza, Egypt, and the West Bank. They lost a $1.5 million contract post-October 7.
- **Peacock Technology:** Their office in Gaza was destroyed. The company has since partially relocated and is licensed to operate in Oman.
- **Tweets Tech:** Their Gaza headquarters was destroyed. Operations were relocated to Egypt and Oman, where they registered a new entity, SOMOOD for IT, in October 2024.
- **WE WILL TECHNOLOGY:** The company lost its Gaza City office and key infrastructure, though it has since resumed operations.

### 6.2 Impact on Freelancers and Mentors

A July 2025 survey of GSG-affiliated mentors and freelancers in Gaza revealed significant challenges:

- **Displacement:** Many are living in tents, schools, or with host families.
- **Loss of Equipment:** A primary need is for new computers, as many lost their devices during the war.
- **Connectivity:** Unreliable internet and electricity are major barriers to work.
- **Personal Toll:** Many reported injuries to themselves or family members, loss of family members, and a need for psychological support.
- **Resilience:** Despite these hardships, a significant number are still actively working for remote companies or on freelance platforms like Upwork, demonstrating immense determination to continue their careers. Their top identified needs are job opportunities, reliable internet access, and new computers.
